                        To configure Heimdall you have to do the following:<br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Create a Surveillance Mode Switch</b><br />
                                Click on the <i>add a device</i> button in your desired zone on the Devices page and select the <i>Mode</i> device from the Heimdall app.<br>
                                Click on <i>Install</i> to procede followed by clicking on <i>next</i>.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Select the device(s) you want to monitor</b><br />
                                Go to the Devices tab in Heimdall's settings page and click on the <i>log</i> button if you just want a line in the log when the device state changes.
                                Click on the <i>Full</i> button if you want the device included when the Surveillance mode is set to <i>Armed</i>
                                If you want the device included when the Surveillance mode is set to <i>Partially Armed</i> click the <i>Partial</i> button.
                                It is possible to select both <i>Full</i> and <i>Partial</i> for one device.
                                If you want to have a delay between the triggering of a device and activating the alarm you can 
                                enable a delay by clicking on the <i>Delay</i> button.<br />
                                The delay that is used can be found on the top of the Settings tab, it is in seconds and ranges from 0-300 seconds.<br />
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Create a flow to enable the Surveillance Mode</b><br />
                                Heimdall will listen to the selected sensors and will log state changes, depending on the selected options on the settings page. 
                                Only when Heimdall is in Surveillance Mode a trigger on a sensor will lead to an alarm.
                                Go to the Homey Flows page and create a flow to set the Surveillance Mode by using the <i>Set Surveillance Mode</i> 
                                card from the Surveillance Mode Switch and selecting the desired state in the <i>...then</i> part.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Create a flow to disable the Surveillance Mode</b><br />
                                To be able to disable the Surveillance Mode with a flow you have to create one and use the <i>Set Surveillance Mode</i> 
                                card from the Surveillance Mode Switch and selecting the <i>Disarmed</i> state in the <i>...then</i> part.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Create a flow to act on an alarm</b><br />
                                You can decide for yourself what you want Homey to do when the alarm is activated. 
                                Create a flow and use the <i>The alarm is activated.</i> card in the <i>when...</i> part and select your desired actions in the <i>then...</i> part.<br />
                                You can use the tag <i>Reason</i> on the trigger card to inform you which device activated the alarm.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Create a flow to disable the alarm</b><br />
                                To deactivate the alarm use the <i>Deactivate Alarm</i> card in a flow in the <i>...then</i> part.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Add an Alarm Off Button</b><br />
                                To deactivate the alarm using the Homey app on your phone you need to add the <i>Alarm</i> button device in the zone you desire.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Log other information</b><br />
                                If you like to log more information, for example presence information, 
                                you can use the <i>Send information to Heimdall</i> card in a flow in the <i>...then</i> part.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
